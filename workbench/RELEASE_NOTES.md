# Evidence Workbench review-preview release notes

## Post-merge review-readiness hardening (in progress)

PR #1 merged into the HostX0 fork at `2048e591`; this is not upstream acceptance. The owner resumed development and explicitly extended the same bounded hourly window on 2026-09-23 without resetting or duplicating it. Historical implementation and hosted validation below are distinct from the current continuation's unpassed acceptance criteria in ROADMAP.md.

- Repair the shared public-web resolver boundary: reject multicast, IPv6 site-local/zone identifiers and explicit special/transition prefixes, including mixed DNS answers before connection.
- Pre-cancelled/expired resolution dispatches no fresh resolver work; cancellation remains bounded even when a caller omits an explicit deadline. An OS resolver already running is not forcibly killed.
- Align current capability/release/model documentation; retain the first-milestone ledger and roadmap byte-for-byte as linked historical files.
- Repair legacy artifact-action setup and LDAP/PortAudio build prerequisites without dropping test/lint commands. Fork Docker CI is build-only, not publication. Other legacy defects remain separately tracked; setup fixes are not an all-green claim.
- Add offline scope/cancellation, candidate-lifecycle and documentation/workflow regression coverage. See PROGRESS.md for exact observed results and unavailable integrations.
- Harden adapter terminal publication: one approved lifecycle cannot execute concurrently twice; a terminal SQLite failure can no longer be mislabeled as an adapter execution failure or durable success. The recoverable state is `interrupted`, no receipt is exposed, and the API directs the operator to check status rather than automatically retry.
- Make dependency-free startup diagnostics actionable without leaking local exception details: `--check-install --json` reports stable failure stages/codes for application files, SQLite, workspace preparation/write access, unsafe lock objects and loopback-port availability while preserving the no-report/no-model/no-scanner preflight boundary.

## 0.1.0 review preview

This is an isolated contribution under `workbench/`; it does not replace the legacy HackGPT entry points and is not a claim of complete penetration-testing coverage.

### Implemented

- Loopback single-operator assessment UI and token-authenticated local API.
- Explicit authorization/scope capture with Analyst and Controlled verification modes.
- Evidence-first report model with finding/evidence digests, hash-linked events and report integrity checks.
- Owned disposable authorization/data proof using a denied control and fresh synthetic canary.
- Shared assessment deadline/cancellation across native DNS, TCP connect, TLS, HTTP response and current Ollama transport.
- SQLite running checkpoints, atomic terminal publication, non-durable failure state and interruption recovery.
- Candidate-only scanner-result parsers for Semgrep JSON, Trivy JSON and Nuclei JSONL. Parser support by itself is not runner support.
- Finite execution registry with typed declarations, operator authority ceiling, a metadata-only project adapter and one bounded HEAD-only web adapter.
- Reviewed `semgrep-project-local/1.177.0-r1` execution adapter using an exact digest-pinned Semgrep CE Linux/amd64 image, repository-authored offline rules, disabled scanner networking/version checks/metrics, read-only source/rules/root filesystem, dropped capabilities, no-new-privileges, host UID/GID mapping, bounded CPU/memory/PIDs/output/deadline and no automatic image pull. The normalized parser removes source snippets/metavariable values and findings remain `candidate`.
- Durable adapter plan/approval/execution lifecycle with exact request-digest binding, minimized stored summaries, authenticated API/GUI controls and versioned execution receipts.
- Coverage-aware retesting and checksummed reviewer evidence bundles.
- Current Ollama adapter with explicit local/cloud processing policy and synthetic protocol self-tests.
- Machine-readable review manifest, CycloneDX SBOM for the isolated shipped component and a revision-generated synthetic sample report.
- Real Chromium browser-to-loopback E2E in CI using the actual token-authenticated server/UI, responsive widths 1440/768/390, accessibility-tree naming checks, keyboard traversal, owned synthetic controlled-verification flow, history rendering and runtime-exception monitoring.
- Fresh-checkout smoke jobs on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu, macOS and Windows runners using only the isolated standard-library workbench path. The smoke starts the real loopback server, exercises authenticated health/adapter discovery, completes the owned synthetic verification, checks durable persistence/integrity and exports the saved report.
- Dedicated scanner-validation CI that pulls the exact reviewed Semgrep image digest before assessment execution and then runs the offline adapter on owned vulnerable and corrected Python fixtures. Evidence Workbench run `35586469998` passed that scanner job and the full native/browser/platform matrix at feature head `c23414f3eb5fc34a0e66d2668ed0165a8d139b09`.

### Experimental or incomplete

- Trivy and Nuclei remain parser-only; ZAP and Nmap execution adapters are not implemented. The Semgrep runner validates one reviewed ruleset/boundary and is not universal language/rule coverage.
- Authenticated external application test accounts/role runners are not implemented.
- Historical run `35589788372` passed one real local Ollama `0.34.2` / `smollm2:135m-instruct-q5_K_M` compatibility probe separately from protocol doubles. Quality/GPU/cloud-provider benchmarking remains unestablished.
- The current real browser E2E is Chromium on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu; it is not a multi-browser compatibility claim and does not replace manual assistive-technology review.
- Historical package run `35589788385` tested the exact same portable source archive on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows before provenance/SBOM attestations. No native installer or bundled scanner/container image is produced.
- GitHub/Sigstore build-provenance and SBOM attestations exist for the historical portable package. These are not signed assessment reports, platform code-signing certificates or a security certification; report checksums remain unsigned.
- Any future executable third-party runner needs its own pinned version/image, checksum, license, sandbox boundary, owned integration fixtures and SBOM/release evidence before it can be described as shipped.
- Application-level encryption at rest and multi-user/public hosting are unsupported.

### Safety and interpretation

`candidate` and `observed_only` are not equivalent to demonstrated exploitation. `verified_in_lab` applies only to the owned synthetic fixture. `not_reproduced` is not renamed fixed. No findings in executed checks is not a security guarantee. Hashes are unsigned and do not prove authorship.

No external target, customer database, reusable credential, paid AI request, persistence or lateral movement is part of the review-preview validation path. The real Semgrep validation scans only repository-owned synthetic fixtures inside an offline least-privilege container.
